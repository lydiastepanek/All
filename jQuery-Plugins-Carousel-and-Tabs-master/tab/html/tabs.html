        The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a devoted, athletic, affectionate, hardworking, brave and protective dog. He is bold, tenacious and vocal, and will guard his home and family at all costs. He is dependable and kind, and wants to be actively involved in the life of his family. He isn't the kind of dog who can be left alone in a backyard. He needs your companionship and attention. He is eager to please you and very easy to train, an obedient and quick learner who excels at dog sports like herding and agility. He can occasionally be stubborn and restless, but for the most part is playful, full of fun, and clownish: he will take a handful of food from you, then run away with it and throw it up in the air before eating it! He is outgoing and loves to be outdoors, to walk or jog with you, or go for romps in the woods. He craves both physical and mental stimulation. He needs a moderate amount of exercise, including a long daily walk to expend his energy and so that he doesn't become overweight. He is very friendly, polite and agreeable to visitors, though he can be wary of strangers if he doesn't learn how meet them while still young. He is a very good and alert watchdog who is quick to sound the alarm. He will bark. And then keep on barking! And keep on barking! He needs to be trained to know when it's time to stop. He gets along fine with dogs and cats he knows and has been raised with, but may chase animals he doesn't know, and if he is a male can be aggressive and territorial toward other male dogs. He will often try to boss and herd other animals. He is very good and patient with considerate children, and instinctively protective of them. He may also attempt to herd them by nipping at their heels, and must be trained not to do this. He is very high shedder, so might not be a good pet if you dislike dog-hair or vacuuming frequently.

      <li class="tab-pane" id="samoyed"><p>
        The Samoyed is an affectionate people-dog who will want to be the center of attention. He will crave your attention and will either behave or misbehave to get it, whichever seems to work better at the time. This is an energetic, athletic, working dog who enjoys hiking, herding, weight pulling, sledding, conformation, and agility. A Samoyed needs a job to do. Early obedience training is important because if you don't establish yourself as the pack leader early on, your Samoyed will take on the role. This is an uncannily intelligent breed who thinks independently. They will learn your command quickly but they will also attach their own interpretation to it. It can be especially difficult to train this breed to walk on a lead, because these dogs were bred to pull. The Samoyed is an energetic breed that needs exercise every day. They do best with a fenced-in yard, as they will chase a cat or squirrel that they find interesting. And once they get away, it can be very hard to get them to come back. Be careful that your Samoyed does not dig his way under your fence to escape, because he will. They are very talented diggers and many of them enjoy "gardening" and will dig and rearrange your garden. Some also enjoy eating foreign objects. The "chewing" phase for a Samoyed can last for years. They can be quite mischievous and are famous for the sparkle in their eye and their ability to smile. These are expressive, vibrant dogs who like to stay busy and like to be involved. They are quick-witted and inquisitive and remain playful for their entire lives. They love to play with and be with children. They are gentle with and very protective of children. The Samoyed makes a very good watch dog. He enjoys watching everything and he will bark a warning if something new and exciting is happening outside, whether it's a squirrel or a burglar. However, once the burglar is through the door, your Samoyed will show him to the silverware. Samoyeds are very vocal and love to bark, yap, yodel, holler, and sing. They truly love the sound of their own voice, but are usually not problem barkers. However, it's really up to your neighbors to define problem barking. The Samoyed is incredibly perceptive of human emotion. Lack of harmony in the home might upset him. He cannot be happy if you are unhappy, and he is known for giving extra cuddles to someone who is sad. They have been known to be extra attentive and loving to family members a few days before those people fall ill. They also seem to know who truly loves them, who just tolerates them, and who dislikes them and will respond accordingly. This is a dog who needs to be with you all the time, everywhere. Lonely Samoyeds are known for chewing the hair off their legs and tails. They need to be with you to be healthy. They will want to ride in the car with you and sleep in the bed with you. They are trusting, loyal, gentle, and loving.

      <li class="tab-pane" id="husky"><p>
        Bred to be a sled dog, the Siberian Husky makes a great all-around dog. They are agreeable, alert, and outgoing. They have amazing endurance, and are always willing to work and want something to do, so they need at least an hour of exercise per day. They also need to be around people or other dogs at all times. They need companionship. A bored or lonely Siberian is a destructive Siberian tearing up couches and cushions. They can easily destroy your house and yard if they decide it's a good idea (and they probably will at some point). Siberians also love to dig! If you let them near your flowerbed, you will no longer have any flowers, or a bed. Siberian Huskies love to run and sometimes they love to run away. They cannot be trusted off leash. You will need a fenced-in yard, and you will need to make sure the fence is secure, because if there is any possible way out, the Siberian Husky will find it. They are excellent escape artists! (And they are not car smart and could get hit by one!) Huskies are also famous for escaping through the front door. If you've seen a crazy woman running all over town in her bathrobe, you now know that she was probably chasing her Siberian. They are not avid barkers, nor are they particularly protective, so they might not alert you when someone is at the door. They are not overly suspicious of strangers, and they are so indiscriminately friendly, that if a burglar breaks into your home, your Siberian might try to lick him to death. While they are not famous for the nuisance bark, they have been known to howl. Siberians are good with children, and love to play with them. They get along well with other dogs, and love to play with other Siberians. They do not however, in general, do well with cats. Sadly, Siberians have been known to kill cats, even ones they've lived with for a while. Siberians need to be supervised around any small animals. Siberians are intelligent and can be a bit stubborn. They can be challenging to train. They are bred to pull, so teaching them to heel can be particularly difficult. They are also usually reluctant to return to you on a recall. You will need to earn his respect and establish yourself as the pack leader. Siberian Huskies have a joyful demeanor, loveable facial expressions, and an exuberant love for life. They are friendly, loving, and enjoy attention. And they need a lot of it.
